# Aaron's Dotfiles
This repo contains my dotfiles, if you want to install Plugins in my file, please read this instruction.

## vim-plug
Install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), this is just a Vim plugin manager which makes your life much easier. Its installation is quite straight forward, just follow step-by-step in the given repo.

## vim-pathogen
Install [vim-pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), another Vim plugin installer.
I use this to install [vim-syntastic] (https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic) and YouCompleteMe.

## YouCompleteMe
This is one of the most pain-in-the-ass plugin, especially for a Windows-user like me.
